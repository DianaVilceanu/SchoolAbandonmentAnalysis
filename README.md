This project analyzes the phenomenon of early school leaving (ESL) across Europe, with a focus on identifying the main economic, geographic, and socio-cultural factors that contribute to school abandonment rates among young people aged 18–24.

The study combines theoretical research, literature review, and empirical data analysis. It includes advanced statistical methods such as stratified random sampling, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, ANOVA analysis, simple and multiple linear regression. Variables analyzed include GDP per capita, inflation rate, labor force participation, and predominant religion.

Key findings highlight significant regional and cultural differences in ESL rates — with Eastern Europe showing higher rates compared to other regions and underline the strong correlation between inflation and school dropout. The research demonstrates that economic and social factors play a crucial role, while some variables like GDP per capita or labor participation may have a less direct impact than initially expected.

The project provided practical experience in applying statistical techniques to real-world data, offering valuable insights for policymakers who aim to reduce early school leaving and improve educational outcomes in Europe.
